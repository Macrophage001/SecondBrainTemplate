# Notes on Practical Typography
---

>[!info] Summary
>The author argues that back in the 90s, websites were ugly due to certain limitations, and that the effects of some of those limitations are still prevalent in some websites today. While the majority of them have shaken off those limitations, we've reached another impasse where website designs have gone from ['Ugly to Boring'](https://practicaltypography.com/websites.html#the-new-cargo-cult)
>
>The solution they introduce, is to try and incorporate more visual designs from [[#^other-mediums | other mediums]] outside the scope of web development, and to constantly explore and innovate the web design space.

## Interesting Points

- **InterestingPoint**:: 💡 According to author, web design has stagnated since the 90s due to five **technical limitations** of the era:
	- Tiny **point sizes** for **body text**.
	- Huge point sizes for **headings**.
	- Reliance on a small handful of **system fonts**, like **Arial**, **Georgia**, and **Verdana**.
	- Page edges crammed with navigation links
	- Layouts built with large blocks of **color**.

- **InterestingPoint**:: 💡 Typography issues were related to the lack of support between older and newer browsers. However, according to the author, that is no longer the case because:
	- Browser Makers have started updating their browsers much quicker, making it less desirable to support older browsers, and making backwards compatibility less of a restraining factor.
	- Every major browser can now produce sophisticated layouts with typography.
	- HTML/CSS Template systems like Bootstrap have made the process of designing layouts more streamlined and generally easier, freeing up designers from getting caught in the weeds instead of actually designing the site. ^template-systems

- **InterestingPoint**:: 💡 A new issue has arisen where websites have gone from ugly due to limitations, to boring and homogenous due to these [[#^template-systems| template systems]].
- **InterestingPoint**:: 💡 Author argues that we should introduce **visual design elements from elsewhere** like Books, Posters, Art, Software, or whatever medium we can. ^other-mediums

## Need to Study More

- **Study**:: 📝 Need to find other mediums with interesting visual elements and study them. Maybe they can be replicated in websites.
