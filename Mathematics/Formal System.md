> A **formal system** is an [abstract structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_structure "Abstract structure") used for inferring [theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem") from axioms according to a set of rules. These rules, which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the **logical calculus** of the formal system. A formal system is essentially an "[axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system")".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system#cite_note-1)
