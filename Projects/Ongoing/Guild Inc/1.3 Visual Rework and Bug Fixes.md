- [x] #important/completed  Set up working progress bars on achievement buttons.
	- [x] #bug Figure out why `AchievementItemButton` Prefab is not working correctly.
		- The `Update` function does work, but the way in which the achievements are loaded into the prefab is what is causing the issue.
		- The `UpdateAchievementInformation` function was only being called when the `LoadAchievements` function was called, and `LoadAchievements` was only being called from the `AchievementsMenuController::GenerateAchievementPanels` function which was a GUI Utility function.
		- #fixed By calling `UpdateAchievementInformation` in the `OnEnable` Event.
	- [x] #bug The `Collect` Button does not reward the player and make the achievement disappear.
		- #fixed The `Button` Component did not have the `CollectReward` function hooked to it.
