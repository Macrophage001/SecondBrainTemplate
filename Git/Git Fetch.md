> [!error]
> Could not merge my branch with the up-to-date version of another branch. 

> [!warning] Potential Cause
> Git could not locate the up to date version using `git pull` (?)

> [!important] Solution
> Make sure to call `git fetch --all` before trying to merge or pull. This will update all the branches on the local machine(?) and allow you to merge with the up-to-date versions of those branches.

### What it does:

> `git fetch` will pull the updates from the remote branches without disturbing your local branch.
> It seems to force things to update as well. I would have expected `git pull` to do the same thing, but maybe there was an issue with how vscode handles git pull that caused some errors, or I did something dumb, which is the likelier scenario honestly.
